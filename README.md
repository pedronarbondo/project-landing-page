Last CSS-specific project from The Odin Project.
Please do note that this project is meant to evaluate layout capabilities
and not design skills. After checking the landing page on different
monitors I came to the realization that the color-palette I chose was
not ideal, but I decided to leave it as-is because it was not the 
main focus of the assignment. 
That said, I also feel it was fun to choose the background images and color-palette
I did because the end-result was an extravagant meme-y landing page.

Edit I: After reviewing the code, I realized there are some extra classes that serve no function.
I've decided to leave the code and the design as-is because it's my first project and 
I believe I'd serve a great purpose to be able to, in the future, look back to see
how much I've advanced.
